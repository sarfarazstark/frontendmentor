# My Frontend Mentor Challenges

Hello! This is my repo where I put all my completed challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

I am learning frontend development and these projects are my practice. I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also some Tailwind CSS. I am trying my best to improve my skills.

## About This Repo

This is the main place for all my projects. The main `index.html` page uses `data.json` to show all projects. It is made with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every project is in its own folder.

## Technologies I Have Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Responsive Design

## Features

I also tried to add some good features to my website.

### SEO & Optimization

*   Good meta tags for SEO so Google can find it.
*   Also meta tags for Facebook and Twitter sharing.
*   I made `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` for search engines.
*   Using canonical URLs so no duplicate page.
*   Images load lazy for faster speed.

### PWA (Progressive Web App)

*   You can install this website like an app on your phone.
*   It works offline also because of service worker.
